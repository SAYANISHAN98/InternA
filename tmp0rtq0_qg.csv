power ahead of the well-being of our Republic – or even national security. 

We can all rightfully wring our hands at how Trump acted after the election but not without at least acknowledging that his entire term was under continuous attack based on information made out of whole cloth. 

Many Democrats (Pelosi, Schiff, et al) were so disingenuous throughout, it gives one pause to wonder why they are suddenly <em>allowing</em> the Hunter Biden story into the public now.&nbsp;

A slightly rational individual might believe it is because the investigation is getting dangerously close to exposing the truth about Hunter, so the MSM may as well get out in front of it (without, of course, apologizing for the ever-so-<em>slight </em>delay).&nbsp;

But a more cynical person (who, me?) may believe it is another part of their master plan based on the obvious and often embarrassing shortcomings of Joe Biden.&nbsp; Might they be considering using the 25th Amendment?&nbsp; They already managed to get one president elected from his basement; surely they can keep Harris in the basement until 2024 when they can run some, hopefully more coherent candidate.

The only problem is that Harris never sticks to the script either.

heavily upon both presidents credibility. Secrets and error, misdeeds and even non

either Republicans or Democrats  or non affiliated which in the name of virtue try to eliminate or trash their opponents.

and produces an explosion

an earthquake, a whirlwind,.....

vilified, trampled down,
sunk beneath the public lash,
by good fortune, falls to death.

But there was much, much more happening behind the scenes, far from the public eye: While Donald Trump and Joe Biden sparred in the media spotlight, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative—an organization spearheaded by the wife of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg—was channeling millions of dollars into election offices all around the country.
In total, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative funneled more than $400 million to election efforts, most of which was siphoned through the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), a non-profit run by a former Obama fellow.
CTCL distributed hundreds of millions in “Zuckerbucks” to thousands of election jurisdictions in 48 states and Washington, D.C. These funds were pitched as “COVID-19 response grants” intended to simply assist election officials in the safe conduct of elections. However, the reality is much different. From Iowa to Florida, the infusion of Zuckerbucks into Democrat-leaning jurisdictions influenced the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. ""

497,2022-04-08 11:15:29.196010,"Trump may face multiple charges. 

""One critical factor in proving Trump guilty of seditious conspiracy to overthrow the election is demonstrating his motivations for using force to disrupt the joint session of Congress tabulating the election results. Prosecutors might be skittish about charging Trump with seditious conspiracy, theorizing that the former president might not have intended for the violence that resulted from his rally on Jan. 6 to try to overthrow the government.
...
Nevertheless, Trump’s willingness — indeed his eagerness — to use violence could be a necessary element for two other possible charges that might be applicable to Trump: conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.

If Trump knew that what he did was illegal&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;that violence would likely ensue, there would be no reasonable doubt he intended for the mob to help him achieve his ends. This was further evidenced by his failure to intervene for 187 minutes while the violence raged. A president does not let a mob rampage at the U.S. Capitol if he believes he is on constitutional footing to challenge an election and have actual evidence of voter fraud; he uses a mob when he is desperate to achieve his ends&nbsp;<em>despite the law and the facts.""</em>

In summing up the texts, Cheney (R-Wyo.) said, “Mr. Meadows’s testimony will bear on another key question before this committee: Did Donald Trump, through action or inaction, corruptly seek to obstruct or impede Congress’s official proceeding to count electoral votes?”
A casual observer might have missed it, but what Cheney was doing here was pointing to a specific criminal statute — a felony,&nbsp;18 U.S. Code § 1512&nbsp;— that she suggests President Donald Trump might have violated.

Have you considered the possibility that the main reason you ""didn't care for Donald Trump"" was that the same media that is covering for President Biden today was lying through its teeth about President Trump every single day he was in office, and thereafter? 

Did he bluster? Sure, he did, and so would you if every intel agency in the government you were supposed to be the head of was doing its level best to accuse you of things you never did, with the media willingly taking the bait every single time.

By the way, that same media and deep state treated President Reagan exactly the same way, even though he maintained professional decorum throughout eight years of such treatment.

But that case is weak.  
There were two supposed “smoking guns” about Joe Biden that conservatives touted in the materials. The first&nbsp;was an email&nbsp;the Post called a “blockbuster,” in which an executive at the Ukrainian gas company Burisma thanked Hunter for the “opportunity to meet your father” in 2015. If you’re steeped in Trumpworld lore, its damning because of the theory that Biden had the corrupt prosecutor general of Ukraine fired to benefit Burisma, and Biden had said he knew nothing about Hunter’s Ukrainian work, but look, a meeting! This appears to amount to Vice President Biden seemingly going to one dinner.
The second involved a business venture that Hunter tried to set up with a Chinese energy tycoon in 2017 (after Joe Biden was no longer vice president).  A former business partner of Hunter’s&nbsp;named Tony Bobulinski&nbsp;came forward to claim “the big guy” was Joe Biden.

When Senators and House Representatives unleash the leverage and unaccountability of social media to do their bidding and take down members of the opposition, they need to pay a high price.

Saying that two Senators will get ""satisfaction"", when the media marinates day after day with its disinformation, is hardly cold comfort.

Our nation needs to re-secure itself to truthful speech, whether it be the complexities of an investigation or the simple destruction of the meaning of pronouns. If it does not, we will continue to walk into a warped zone of manipulation, and the early evidence is not promising.

Beginning in April or May 2016, Roger Stone repeatedly conveyed to Trump and senior Campaign staff that WikiLeaks would be releasing information damaging to Clinton. After the July 22 WikiLeaks release, Trump and senior Campaign officials believed Stone had
access to non-public information about WikiLeaks's ability and intent to release emails harmful to Clinton.&nbsp;

Manafort in turn tasked Stone to contact Julian Assange, and Stone endeavored to reach Assange through several intermediaries.

First there is no evidence that Hunter took money from Russia; Trump made that up and the wingnut press keeps repeating it.

Second, it was Trump who tried to blackmail Zelenskyy to find dirt on the Bidens. 
In July 2019, according to The Washington Post, Trump
blocked nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. 
On July 25, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke in what Trump later called a “perfect phone call.” According to the Ukrainian readout of the call, the two leaders discussed “investigation of corruption cases.”While on the call, Zelenskiy mentioned his government’s need to purchase anti-tank missiles from the U.S., according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House. Trump responded, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, and said he
should talk to Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr.

Third, Trump’s Treasury Department labeled Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach “an active Russian agent for over a decade.” Derkach provided Russian disinformation, including doctored videos, to Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Ron Johnson to damage Joe Biden, which Trump promoted. Derkach told the press that he had
provided Johnson information, which Johnson denied, but the Senate has a mail
receipt showing he did.&nbsp; Russian proxy is one of Johnson's long time roles, dating back to when he led a group of eight Republicans to Moscow over July 4th, 2019.

""Rudy Giuliani tells Tucker Carlson he offered FBI
agents Hunter Biden’s laptop during raid""&nbsp;
(several sources including The Independent, (April 30, 2021).

Two computer experts, in the WashPost, said their examinations found evidence that people other than Hunter Biden had accessed the drive and written files to it, both before and after the initial stories in the New York Post and long after the laptop itself had been turned over to the FBI.


If Hunter was corrupt for a few million, what about the Trump spawn? They reportedly made $640 million while working in the white House and using gov't transportation for their businesses and even vacations. By their own admissions, Ivanka and Jared took in as much as $135m in income during
their second year as White House aides... according to their financial
disclosures. (The Guardian-June 2019)
