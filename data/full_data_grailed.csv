Dear valued customer:
●All Measurements were been measured flat on the floor.

ATTENTION :

Shipping price can vary depending on your location, I ship through Correos Chile which is the postal service of my country, it is relatively cheap but it takes from 2 weeks to one month to arrive. You can track it through correos.cl and once it leaves Chile it creates a label in USPS so you can track it there too.

I also offer Fedex/DHL/UPS shipping which is more expensive but faster, let me know where are you located and I can give you the options available.

There is a quarter zipper, snap buttons on the placket for extra wind protection, a kangaroo pocket, and hand warmer pockets. This jacket actually has a bit of heft despite looking only like a windbreaker. Gore-tex finish is a good feature too.
There are tiny black specks on the red parts of the fabric; see pictures. You can only really see it up close; I would wear this all the time in the rain on the east coast. Some fading on the hand warmer cuff. There is an undone stitch on the back of the collar near where the hoodie is attached; you can't see it because the hood flap covers it, but it's an easy fix if you're handy with a needle.

Not really, Russian post works pretty fast and usually it takes around 10-21 days with regular post (sometimes it takes 10 days, sometimes it takes 20 days), due to covid everything is changed. COVID-19 causing some postal service delays, not only with Russia, with any countries. Please note: if its not updated shortly - it's not lost, just delays.

Dear valued customer:
●All Measurements were been measured flat on the floor.

●Please Dont worry about Custom tax fees during Shipping because I always declared all items as a Gift and wrote the value lower than original price usually just $10 only.
●Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any inquiries.Its my great pleasure to have a conversation with customers.
ATTENTION :
Please pay close attention to measurements provided.
Do not rely on tag size as pre-worn items may have been altered, stretched or shrunk & vintage sizes do not directly translate the modern sizes.The best way to ensure a correct fit is to compare our measurements with the measurements of a similar item that you know fits you well. Please enlarge the photos for clearer image.
** Please do not expect the shirt in mint condition unless stated. It's because vintage and used items may have sign of wear.
